# Mind Matter Questions Host

(Previously systole)

[https://jennydaman.github.com/mindmatter](https://jennydaman.github.com/mindmatter) hosts the question database for systole. 

Mind Matter will communicate with this host using javascript XMLHTTPRequests. 
`/subjectsDB.json` is the list of all the subjects and questions. 

To regenerate subjectsDB.json:
```shell
scripts/gensl.py subjects > subjectsDB.json
```

# Contributing

Would you like to add some questions, or even a new subject? Fork this repo, add the questions, and create a pull request!

Subfolders of `/subjects` holds JSON files that represent questions. 

`/subjects/subject_name` represents a directory containing questions of the same subject.

`/subjects/subject_name/title` stores a pretty title for the specific subject directory.

`/subjects/questionTemplate.json` demonstrates the appropriate format for a question file. 


One day in the distant future, I wil simplify this process by creating an HTML form that will automatically generate .json files and submit them for review.
