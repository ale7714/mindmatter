<em>Mind Matter</em> is free and open source software, lisenced under the WTFPL. Idea and extension development by Jennings
Zhang. He is not very good at website development, so most of what you see was actually
<del>stolen</del> borrowed from
<a href="http://todomvc.com" target="_blank">TodoMVC</a> and <a href="https://preactjs.com" target="_blank">Preact &#x1f680;</a>.<br/>"Brain In Pot" icon artwork by a friend, Sally Zhao.
</p>

<p>
    The idea started as a project for <em>Bitcamp 2017</em>. Mind Matter uses the <code>chrome.storage.sync</code> API, meaning
    that your settings will be synced with your Google account. See <a href="https://github.com/jennydaman/mindmatter/blob/master/README.md"
