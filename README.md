*Previously known as jennydaman/systole.* 
*Just kidding, nobody knew about it...*

What started as a (unsuccessful) [Bitcamp 2017](https://devpost.com/software/systole) project is now a full (and still unsuccessful :persevere:) Chrome extension!

Mind Matter is a Chrome extension that can help you learn new things and stay productive. When attempting to access a "distracting" site, such as Facebook or Reddit, *Mind Matter* will block the site, preventing access until a multiple choice question is answered correctly. 

###### Rationale

Psychologist Daniel Kahneman describes two systems of thinking. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Fast_and_Slow), "'System 1' is fast, instinctive, and emotional; 'System 2' is slower, more deliberative, and more logical." Unfortunately, us citizens of the internet do too much mind-numbing System 1 thinking while we pass time consuming memes. The goal of Mind Matter is to deter the user from frequently browsing time-wsting sites, and instead to focus on what matters in life. The questions provided intend to stimulate System 2 thinking. A user should perform a little thinking or research in order to respond to the question.

AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT

Well, odds are you don't have time for the site you want to visit...

IF I DON'T SEE A MEME IN THE NEXT SECOND I'M GOING TO GET AN CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT 

If you need to get to r/iamverysmart that bad, temporarily disable Mind Matter (but pls don't uninstall (jk go ahead not like I made money off this)).
