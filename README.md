*Just kidding, nobody knew about it...*

Mind Matter blocks blacklisted sites, granting access only if a trivia question is answered correctly. It deters excessive use of distrating websites while helping users to reinforce their knowledge.

### Rationale

The psychologist Daniel Kahneman describes two systems of thinking. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Fast_and_Slow), "'System 1' is fast, instinctive, and emotional; 'System 2' is slower, more deliberative, and more logical."

Surfing the Internet tends to be unproductive. The objective of *Mind Matter* is to disrupt cognitive ease and force users to perform system 2 thinking.

Thanks to Sally Zhao (Blair class of 2019) for the "brain in pot" logo.

Mr. Daniel Kim @dankimchi did a few things.

*systole* was originally my [Bitcamp 2017](https://devpost.com/software/systole) idea. Without any experience with front-end web development, it was wholly unsuccessful. Misha let me submit *Mind Matter* to [BlairHacks_0](http://hacks.mbhs.edu/) [(Local Hack Day 2017)](https://localhackday.mlh.io/).
